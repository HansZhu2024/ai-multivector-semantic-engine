# Technical Whitepaper: AI-Driven Multi-Vector Semantic Query System Based on Data Content and Program Semantics
1. Project Overview
This project proposes a semantic query architecture leveraging AI to analyze both database field values and their contextual usage in source code. These semantics are encoded as embeddings and stored across multiple vector databases. The system enables intelligent query generation based on natural language input by combining vector search and LLM-based reasoning, thus supporting automation in querying structured data sources.
________________________________________
2. System Architecture
The architecture comprises five distinct semantic vector stores, each capturing a different facet of field-level meaning:
2.1 Vector DB A – Field Content Semantics
•	Extract representative samples (e.g., first 1000 records) from each database column.
•	Convert value distributions into descriptive natural language.
•	Embed the descriptions using a model such as BGE-base-zh-v1.5.
•	Store the vectors in Vector DB A to represent the field’s intrinsic data semantics.
Code Example:
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

sample_values = ['2024-01-01', '2024-01-15', '2024-02-01']
description = f"This column contains dates like: {', '.join(sample_values[:3])}"

model = SentenceTransformer("bge-base-zh-v1.5")
vector = model.encode(description)
________________________________________
2.2 Vector DB B – Code Usage Semantics
•	Statistically analyze all CRUD operations in source code.
•	Automatically extract context for each field (e.g., filter conditions, update targets).
•	Convert contextual logic into natural language and generate embeddings.
•	Store results in Vector DB B to reflect functional semantics from application code.
Code Example:
code_snippet = "order = db.query(Order).filter(Order.created_at >= '2024-01-01')"
prompt = f"Describe the semantic intent of the fields in the following code:\n{code_snippet}"
summary = local_llm(prompt)
embedding = model.encode(summary)
________________________________________
2.3 Vector DB C – Semantic Integration & Reasoning Layer
•	Perform similarity and alignment reasoning between vectors in DB A, B, D, and E.
•	Establish high-level relations such as synonym fields, entity equivalence, or data lineage.
•	Store integrated relationships in Vector DB C for downstream LLM prompt enrichment.
Code Example:
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

similarity = cosine_similarity([vector_a], [vector_b])[0][0]
if similarity > 0.85:
    print("Strong semantic relation found")
________________________________________
2.4 Vector DB D – View-Level Semantics (Optional Extension)
•	Parse and document metadata of SQL Views including joins and aggregations.
•	Generate embeddings for view descriptions and store in Vector DB D.
Code Example:
view_description = "This view aggregates sales data by region and month."
vector_view = model.encode(view_description)
________________________________________
2.5 Vector DB E – Stored Procedure Semantics (Optional Extension)
•	Analyze stored procedure logic and parameterization intent.
•	Generate descriptive vectors and store in Vector DB E.
Code Example:
sp_description = "Stored procedure calculates quarterly revenue for a given region."
vector_sp = model.encode(sp_description)
________________________________________
3. Query Execution Pipeline
3.1 Natural Language Input
User prompt:
“Analyze the order volume from Q1 to Q4 in 2024.”
3.2 Semantic Vectorization
query_vec = model.encode("Analyze the order volume from Q1 to Q4 in 2024")
3.3 Multi-Vector Database Retrieval
results_A = vector_db_A.search(query_vec)
results_B = vector_db_B.search(query_vec)
results_D = vector_db_D.search(query_vec)
results_E = vector_db_E.search(query_vec)
3.4 Prompt Assembly for LLM Inference
prompt = f"""
User Question: "Analyze the order volume from Q1 to Q4 in 2024"

[Vector DB A]:
{results_A}

[Vector DB B]:
{results_B}

[Vector DB D]:
{results_D}

[Vector DB E]:
{results_E}

Tasks:
1. Identify relevant fields.
2. Determine time range filtering logic.
3. Define aggregation method for order volume.
4. Generate the appropriate SQL query.
"""
response = local_llm(prompt)
3.5 Auto-Generated SQL
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('quarter', created_at) AS quarter,
       SUM(amount) AS total_orders
FROM orders
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
  AND status = 'completed'
GROUP BY quarter
ORDER BY quarter;
